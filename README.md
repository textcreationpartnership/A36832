1. CHAP. III. That upon the ground of this Hypotheſis, That every Supream Authority, either in the Popiſh or the Presbyterian Church, is ſubject to Error; Monſieur de Condom hath reaſon to approve of the Congregational way, and the Independency of particular Churches on any other Authority than that of Jeſus Chriſt in his VVord.

1. CHAP. IV. That the deſign of the Congregational Churches is moſt holy and moſt reaſonable, when they labour to retain a Conformity of Faith with the other Reformed Churches, but take the liberty to differ from them in matter of Diſcipline: Of the veneraiton they have for Calvin, and for the Churches which follow his Doctrine and Diſcipline.

1. CHAP. V. That the Congregational Churches do moſt rationally Eſtabliſh the Authority of Synods and Paſtors, and the nature of the Church.

1. CHAP. VI. An Anſwer to thoſe who ſay that the Congregational way is Incompatible with the Civil power; and that it deprives the Magiſtrate of the Right he hath to the Government of the Church; that it is Introductory of Irreligion, Ignorance, and Schiſm in the Church.

Of the Wiſe and Prudent carriage of the Independants, and of their way to get further off the Church of Rome than any other, and to condemn all the wayes of Reconciliation with it, and the Churches that hold any Communion with Rome, that the indeavour to come near it is damnable and pernicious, as is ſufficiently ſeen in the preſent poſture of the affairs of England.

1. CHAP. XI. A continuance of the ſame matter concerning the wiſe carriage of thoſe Churches that are for their way Congregational, when they condemn all manner of ſpeaking like to Rome, and all practiſes, that do any whit ſavour of theirs: and the ſix Maxims on which the Pope and his Church are founded: a Confirmation of that by a Hiſtory taken out of the Life of Joſeph Hall.

1. CHAP. XII. An Apology for the Author of the Conformity of the congregational Churches with that of the Antient Primitive Chriſtians: That a diſintereſſed perſon, ſuch as he, is the moſt ſit to write about theſe matters.
